+  Bus-Line-Simulation-GAMA
This project aims to use the generic Agent-based Modeling Architecture (GAMA) to create agents, monitor their behavior, and simulate their interactions within a bus line. QGIS is be used to create a graphical view of the simulation.

+ KMeans Implementation In Gama

+ Ecosystem Marin
